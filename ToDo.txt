String Demo

Just an idea I had, to create a semi-random line (small) composed of line
segments, possibly overlapping.  Then randomly move it and rotate it around
the screen, changing color slowly.  The string should be rotated to match the
direction it is moving in, and direction should change in smallish increments
to avoid jerking.

Constrain the "string" to fit into a 20x20 square [say], and allow it to move
that far offscreen before bouncing back.  Oh yeah, it bounces.  It doesn't
move randomly, or not much, it moves in straight lines and bounces off the
(offscreen) walls.  It does turn to match direction, but it does so offscreen,
so no worries about jerkiness.  Me like.

I just thought it would look cool.

Code I need:

* Create a window [Done]
* size window to screen (fullscreen?)
* Get screen coordinates, add enough to fit offscreen. (see rotfl.ui) [Maybe
  not?]
* Timing loop (see NSTimer) [Done]
* Color cycling [Done]
* Create the app [Done]
* Draw a NSBezierPath [Done]
* Rotate a NSBezierPath [Done]
* Translate a NSBezierPath [Done]
* NSBezierPath from points [Done]
* ColorCycler as simple generator [Done]
* Bounce around screen forever [Done]
* Vary bounce angle, speed? [Done]
* Start with random color [Done]
* Start with random vector [Done]
* Start with random rotation [Done]
* Make vectors based on degrees, not simple integers [Nope]
* Add curves to follow? [Nope]
* Allow brush to move slightly off-screen [Done]
* Allow brush (black lines) to be hidden [Done]
* Make it a screen saver? [Done]
* Fix bug where it gets stuck at the edge
